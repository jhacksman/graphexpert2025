- **Relationship-Based Permissions**: Permissions derived from organizational relationships
- **Path Analysis**: Identifying unintended access paths
- **Impact Assessment**: Understanding the effects of permission changes

### Implementation Approach
- User, group, role, and resource nodes
- Permission and membership relationship edges
- Hierarchical structures for organizational units
- Path queries for access verification

## Network and IT Management

### Overview
Graph databases help manage complex IT infrastructures by modeling dependencies between systems, applications, and services.

### Key Benefits
- **Dependency Tracking**: Understanding what relies on what
- **Impact Analysis**: Assessing the effects of changes or outages
- **Root Cause Analysis**: Tracing issues to their source
- **Capacity Planning**: Visualizing resource allocation and usage

### Implementation Approach
- Nodes for servers, applications, services, and network components
- Edges representing dependencies and connections
- Properties capturing performance metrics and configuration
- Traversal queries for dependency chains
